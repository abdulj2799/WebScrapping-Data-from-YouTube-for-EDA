# WebScrapping-Data-from-YouTube-for-EDA
I developed a Python project to scrape YouTube data using the YouTube Data API. The project involves extracting data, loading it into a Pandas DataFrame, analyzing it, and visualizing insights with the Seaborn library.

In the first part, I retrieved channel details of top Data Analysts and Data Scientists on YouTube, including channel name, total subscribers, total views, and the number of videos posted. I then compared these channels to determine which has the highest subscriber count, the most views, and the largest number of uploaded videos. This data was structured in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis, followed by basic visualizations to facilitate comparisons.

In the second part, I focused on extracting video details from the "Alex The Analyst" channel. I gathered information such as video titles, total views, likes, and comments for each video. This data was then loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. Finally, I created simple visualizations using Seaborn to better understand the performance of the channelâ€™s videos.
